59968,Our Idiot Brother,"Everybody has the sibling who is always just a little bit behind the curve when it comes to getting his life together. For sisters Liz, Miranda and Natalie, that person is their perennially upbeat brother Ned, an erstwhile organic farmer whose willingness to rely on the honesty of mankind is a less-than-optimum strategy for a tidy, trouble-free existence. Ned may be utterly lacking in common sense, but he is their brother and so, after his girlfriend dumps him and boots him off the farm, his sisters once again come to his rescue. As Liz, Miranda and Natalie each take a turn at housing Ned, their brother's unfailing commitment to honesty creates more than a few messes in their comfortable routines. But as each of their lives begins to unravel, Ned's family comes to realize that maybe, in believing and trusting the people around him, Ned isn't such an idiot after all.",Comedy Drama,brothersisterrelationship sistersisterrelationship familyclan idealist duringcreditsstinger,PaulRudd ElizabethBanks ZooeyDeschanel,JessePeretz,"[59968, 5178, 59917, 23685, 63020, 9718, 77495, 698, 454, 13950, 46332, 12602, 22301, 22907, 228165, 1792, 10314, 9988, 12819, 22972, 72213, 244114, 250184, 12400, 28353, 20455, 4944, 9466, 4995, 2447, 33196, 277216, 9772, 98, 37799, 9388, 27936, 60400, 8848, 54580, 361475, 253626, 152742, 2133, 11658, 202575, 1402, 76285, 77174, 844]"

289180,H.,"H. is a modern interpretation of a classic Greek tragedy in which two women, each named Helen, live out their mirrored lives of one another in the town of Troy, NY. The first Helen is in her 60s, lives with her husband Roy, and takes care of a small, extremely lifelike baby doll called a “Reborn Doll,” which she cares for as a living baby. The second Helen is in her 30s, has a successful art career with her partner Alex, and is four months pregnant. One night, something falls out of the sky and explodes over the town. In the aftermath of this event, bizarre and unexplainable things begin to happen. Many people in the town go missing—Helen’s husband being one of them—and unnatural cloud formations begin appearing in the sky.
